Right now I only have the board set up without any way of checking weather or not moves are legal or not

list of things to do: 
-create a moves list for each peice and check if the move is legal when trying to make one
-maybe try to fix the fen string interpretation and extend
-make some way for it to make moves when you do instead of just ending immediatley
